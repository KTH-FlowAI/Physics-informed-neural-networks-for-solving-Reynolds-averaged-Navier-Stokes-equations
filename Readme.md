# Physics-informed neural networks for solving Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations

## Introduction
The code in this repository features a Python implemention of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANs)equations for incompressible turbulent flows without any specific model or assumption for turbulence. The input data are spatial coordinates (*x*, *y*) only taken at the domain boundaries. 

More details about the implementation and results from the training are available in ["Physics-informed neural networks for solving Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations", Hamidreza Eivazi, Mojtaba Tahani, Philipp Schlatter, Ricardo Vinuesa](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/5.0095270)(2022,*Physics of Fluids*)

## Pre-requisites
The code was run successfully using Tensorflow>=2.6.0, using 1 GPU for training. In addition, scipy is necessary for implementing optimization algorithm

## Data
The dataset used for training and testing are available in order to ensure the reproducibility of the results. 

### Larger dataset (2024.11.21)
In this repository, the database for *zero-presure-gradient* Boundary Layer and turbulent flows over NACA4412 airfoil are split into small batches for sake of downloading.
Please, follow the instructions in [./ZPG/readme.md](./ZPG/readme.md) and [./NACA4412/readme.md](./NACA4412/readme.md) to reconnect the dataset.

##  Training and inference
The PINNs training and prediction can be performed after cloning the repository. 

Take *Falker-Skan*(FS) Boundary Layer as example:
    
    git clone  https://github.com/Fantasy98/Physics-informed-neural-networks-for-solving-Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-equations.git
    cd FS
    python train.py


All the training parameters are defined in the [train_configs.py](https://github.com/Fantasy98/Physics-informed-neural-networks-for-solving-Reynolds-averaged-Navier-Stokes-equations/blob/9f05eac466ed6f15638de9ec173e4826059b0b49/FS/train_configs.py)

For postprocessing the reults, it can be performed as follows:
    
    python postprocessing.py

## File Structure
All cases follow the same file structure, take *Falker-Skan*(FS) Boundary Layer as example, the files follow structure below:
